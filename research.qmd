There are my research projects:

## Ongoing projects

### Project 1- Construction of infectious clone porcine delta coronavirus

First the plasmid pUC19 + Amprocillin was transformed in to E. coli and incubated for 12 hours at 37 degree celsius.

### Project 2- Electroporation in Vero cells

Vero cells were then electroporated with the full length genomic DNA and N gene segment. These electroporated cells were then incubated.

## Past projects

1.  Sparrow coronavirus, Covid-19, Bovine coronavirus
